COVID-19 prediction is a system of prediction COVID-19 online, without having the patient physically. We are using Primary Data for Machine Learning algorithms. It predicts based on the user-provided symptoms. 

It will publish soon on **[npj journal](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/about/npj-series)**
